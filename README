These are some utility functions for parallel manipulation of flatfiles.  Because 
of Go's ability to cross-compile 100% static binaries, it's very easy to distribute
them to remote servers with arcane versions of GNU coreutils installed and use them
as replacements for, eg, sort and shuffle (where the latter even exists).
